 <h1 align="center">Office dashboard.</h1>

## Description.

The project was made for the internal ecosystem of the "Sber" company. Using this web-app you can easily display all the useful
information about the office to a potential employee in the dashboard format. Information about the number of jobs, internal values of the company/employees, geography of employees.
We tried to do everything so that the employee would understand in what a lovely place he would work.
Not mobile-friendly yet because of features of the release platform
